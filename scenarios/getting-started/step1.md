Garden ships with an interactive command center we call the dev console. To start the dev console, run:  `garden dev`

```
garden dev
```{{exec}}

<br>

The first time you run garden dev, Garden will initialize then await further instructions inside a REPL. From inside the REPL you can command Garden to build, test, and deploy your project. <br>

After running garden dev, you're ready to deploy your project. Run:

```
deploy
```{{exec}}
